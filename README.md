    <p>
        Every moment spent with you feels like a dream. From your smile to the way you make everything around us feel so warm and special, 
        you are the light of my life. Thank you for being you — kind, loving, and absolutely amazing. I am so lucky to have you by my side.
        <br><br>
        I promise to cherish and love you every single day, just like today. You mean the world to me, and I can't wait to spend forever 
        with you. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH ❤️
